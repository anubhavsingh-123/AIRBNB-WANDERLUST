“Wanderlust is my personal full-stack travel booking platform inspired by Airbnb. Users can register and log in, explore listings created by others, and create their own property listings with images, price, location, and descriptions. I implemented full CRUD functionality — adding, editing, deleting, and viewing listings — along with a review system where users can leave ratings and comments on other listings.”

“The platform supports user and host dashboards, secure authentication, and proper access control so that only the listing owner can modify or delete their properties. It features a mobile-responsive UI and dynamic listing management that adapts to different roles.”

“The backend is built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, while authentication is handled through Passport.js and JWT. The UI is rendered using EJS and Bootstrap, and the application is deployed using MongoDB Atlas for scalable cloud storage.”
